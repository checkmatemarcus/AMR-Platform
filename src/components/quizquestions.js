        question: '"Antibiotics only target harmful bacteria."',
        answer: false,
        explanation: "This statement is false because antibiotics can also affect beneficial bacteria in the body.",
        reference: "Reference: <a href='https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance' target='_blank' class='font-bold text-green-500 hover:text-green-700'>World Health Organization</a>",
      },
    {
        question: '"Overuse of broad spectrum antibiotics can drive \
        antimicrobial resistance."',
        answer: true,
        explanation: "When antimicrobials are necessary to treat an infection that is not life-threatening,\
        a narrow-spectrum antibiotic should generally be first choice. Indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotic\
        creates a selective advantage for bacteria resistant to these 'last-line' broad-spectrum agents.\
        and also kills nomrla commensla fiora leaving people susceptible to antibiotic-resistant harmful bacteria such as 'Clostridium difficile'",

    {
        question: '"The risk of mortality without access to effective\
        antibiotics may make some treatments and surgical procedures too \
        risky to continue"',
        answer: true,
        explanation: "Modern medicine, especially surgery and cancer treatments, depends\
        on effective antibiotics to minimise the risk of infection. Currently,\
        antibitoics reduce post-operative infections rates to belove to 2.0%. Without\
        effective antibiotics, this could increase to around 40% to 50%. Up to 30% of these patients\
        could die from reistant to bacterial infections. The rick of mortality without access\
        to effective antibiotics may make some treatments and surgical procedures too risky to continue",

      },
    {
        question: '"Use of antibiotics only has an impact on the patient\
        taking them."',
        answer: false,
        explanation: "Use of antibiotics has an impact not just for the patient using them\
        but the global community as well. The more antimicrobials are used, the more likely it is that\
        that resistance will develop",
        reference: "Reference: <a href='https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance' target='_blank' class='font-bold text-green-500 hover:text-green-700'>World Health Organization</a>",
      },
    {
        question: '"The development of antibiotic resistance took many years to emerge\
        and was completely unexpected."',
        answer: false,
        explanation: "Antibiotics were first prescribed in the 1904s, and pencillin resistance became a substanial\
        clinical issue in the 1950s. In an interview shortly after winning the Nobel Prize in 1945\
        for discroving penicillin, Alecander Fleming said: 'The thoughtless person playing with\
        penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of the man who succumbs to...",
