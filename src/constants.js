export const bacterial_answer = `Imagine you're in a room with a bunch of mischievous mice and you have a mousetrap that can catch most of them. Over time, a few mice learn
how to evade or escape from the trap. These smart mice then have baby mice, and their babies also learn how to avoid the trap. Eventually, you'll have a room full of mice, 
and your once-effective mousetrap can't catch any of them. The mice have become 'resistant' to your mousetrap.

Now, let's relate this to bacteria.

Bacteria are tiny living things that can cause infections. Just as you use mousetraps to get rid of mice, doctors use antibiotics (medicines) to kill harmful bacteria. However, just like the mice, some bacteria can learn to defend themselves against these medicines. When this happens, the medicines, or "antibiotics", might stop working against them. These bacteria have become "resistant".

The more we use antibiotics, the more chances bacteria have to learn how to become resistant. This is why it's really important to use antibiotics only when we truly need them.`;
export const resistant_answer = `Imagine you have a lock on your front door to keep out unwanted guests. One day, a sneaky thief learns how to pick your lock and get inside. If you keep using the same lock, the thief will keep getting in because he's learned how to beat it. The thief has become "resistant" to your lock.

Similarly, when you get sick, the medicine is like a lock that keeps out the "thieves" (harmful bacteria). But if the bacteria learn how to beat the medicine, just like the thief learned to pick the lock, then that medicine might not work well anymore.

The important thing to remember is that it's not you that becomes resistant; it's the harmful bacteria inside you. When a medicine doesn't work as well as it used to, it might mean the bacteria have figured out how to "pick the lock."

To help our "locks" (medicines) work effectively, it's crucial to use them correctly, as prescribed by a doctor.

What should I tell to my physicians about my previous medication?

Imagine you're baking cookies and someone else offers to help you finish. But you forget to tell them you've already added sugar. If they add sugar again without knowing, the cookies will be too sweet and might not taste right.

Similarly, when you visit a doctor, it's like starting a new batch of cookies. If you don't tell them what "ingredients" (or medicines) you've already taken, they might give you something that doesn't mix well with what you had before. It's especially important to mention any problems or "bad reactions" you had, just like you'd tell someone if a certain ingredient made your cookies taste odd.

In simpler terms: Always let your doctor know about your previous medicines, especially antibiotics, and any issues you experienced with them. This way, they can give you the best "recipe" for your health.`;
export const prevent_answer = `Imagine your favorite toy as a kid. If you played with it too much and in ways it wasn't designed for, it might break or wear out faster. Similarly, antibiotics are powerful "tools" in medicine. If we use them too often or not as intended, they might not work as effectively in the future because bacteria learn how to "dodge" them.

To ensure our "toys" (antibiotics) remain in good working condition, here's what you can do:

1. **Take as Prescribed**: Only take antibiotics when prescribed by a doctor. Finish the entire prescription, even if you feel better before it's done.
2. **No Sharing**: Don't share your antibiotics with others or take leftover antibiotics from previous illnesses.
3. **Avoid Pressure**: Don't pressure your doctor to prescribe antibiotics. Trust their judgment on the best treatment.
4. **Hand Hygiene**: Wash your hands regularly. Clean hands can stop infections from spreading, reducing the need for antibiotics.
5. **Stay Updated with Vaccines**: Ensure you're up-to-date with your vaccines. Vaccines can prevent infections that might require antibiotic treatments.
6. **Safe Food Practices**: Cook meat to the recommended temperature and avoid consuming raw milk or uncooked/undercooked seafood to prevent foodborne bacterial infections.

By following these steps, you're ensuring that our powerful "tools" (antibiotics) remain effective for longer, helping everyone stay healthier.`;
